# MATSim Melbourne 2016 Example Scenario

This example contains a very small Melbourne population sample (0.1%), see [video](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/KQfaxJPsTr5dfpE) and associated [legend for colours used](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/qBpRrKQ2RpgQ3cT).

To run the example, first download the required files manually or by doing:
```
./prepare.sh
```

Also download and unzip the the [latest MATSim GUI](https://www.matsim.org/downloads/#gui) into the current directory.

Then start the MATSim GUI by double-clicking in the extracted JAR file, select the Configuration file `./config.xml`, and press **Start MATSim** to run the simulation. The MATSim output will by default be saved to `./output`.
